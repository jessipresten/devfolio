Welcome to my CS50 portfolio! This repository showcases my completed coursework and projects from the following Harvard University courses:

CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x)

CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

ðŸ§  What You'll Find
Each folder contains my personal solutions and projects that demonstrate skills in:

Problem solving & algorithms (search, sort, recursion, etc.)

Python programming (data structures, OOP, file I/O)

Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Django)

Databases (SQL, ORM with Django)

Security & testing (input validation, authentication, pytest)

Version control (using Git and GitHub)
